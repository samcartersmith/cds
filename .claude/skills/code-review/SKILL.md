# CDS React Component Code Reviews

Check for the following:

- Structure: does the component's file follow the correct structure of imports, styles, types, and component?
- Type safety: were any changes made backwards compatible? Were there any breaking changes? Are props clearly typed and following best practices? Are there any props that are unused / missing?
- Styling: does the component rely on css variables and theme tokens where possible? Are there any missing className or styles props?
- Accessibility: does the component follow best practices for accessibility for the platform?
- Tests & stories: is the component used in a meaningful way by Jest tests and have story examples?
