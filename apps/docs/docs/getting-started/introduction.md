# Coinbase Design System

Welcome to the Coinbase Design System (CDS) documentation! CDS is a cross-platform component library built with TypeScript, designed to streamline the development of React and React Native applications. It empowers developers with consistent, reusable, and accessible components that adhere to Coinbase's design principles.

## What is CDS?

CDS is a unified component library that supports both web and mobile platforms, ensuring a cohesive user experience across devices. By using CDS, you can:

- **Accelerate Development**: Use pre-built, customizable components to focus on building features instead of reinventing UI elements.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain a uniform look and feel across your application by leveraging Coinbase's design language.
- **Improve Performance**: Optimized for speed and scalability, with static CSS for the web and efficient styling for React Native.
- **Streamline Theming**: Easily apply consistent theming across your app with CDS's ThemeProvider and theme variables.
- **Enhance Accessibility**: Benefit from accessible components designed with inclusive user experiences in mind.

## Key Features

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

CDS provides components for both React (web) and React Native (mobile), ensuring your application delivers a consistent experience regardless of platform. Web components are imported from `@cbhq/cds-web`, and React Native components are imported from `@cbhq/cds-mobile`.

### Powerful Theming

The CDS ThemeProvider allows you to define a custom theme for your application. On the web, CDS utilizes CSS Variables for high-performance styling, while React Native components use a theme Context for dynamic theming. With a unified theming system, you can:

- Customize colors, spacing, typography, and more.
- Create light and dark themes effortlessly.
- Ensure design fidelity across platforms.

### Comprehensive Component Library

CDS includes a wide variety of components, from layout primitives like `Box`, `HStack`, and `Grid` to stateful, interactive components like `Accordion`, `Modal`, and `Dropdown`. These components are:

- Fully customizable via props and theming.
- Designed to meet modern accessibility standards.
- Tested and optimized for performance.

### Responsive Design

On the web, CDS components support responsive styles out of the box. Use the responsive syntax to adjust layouts and styles based on device breakpoints without writing custom media queries.

### Built for Performance

- **Static CSS for Web**: Linaria generates static CSS, ensuring small HTML diffs for server-side rendering (SSR) and fast client-side rendering.
- **Optimized Native Styling**: React Native components leverage the `StyleSheet` API for performant rendering on mobile devices.
